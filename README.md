## 📖 Introduction

C is a powerful general-purpose programming language that has been widely used for system and application software development. This repository aims to cover all essential aspects of C programming, from basic syntax to advanced topics..

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started with C programming, you'll need to set up a development environment. Here's how:

1. **Install a C Compiler**: You can use GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) or any other C compiler.
2. **Set Up an IDE**: While you can use any text editor, IDEs like Code::Blocks, CLion, or Visual Studio Code can provide a more streamlined experience.

## 🔍 Basic Concepts

1. **Hello World**: The simplest C program.
2. **Data Types**: Understanding different data types in C.
3. **Variables and Constants**: How to declare and use variables and constants.
4. **Operators**: Arithmetic, logical, and relational operators.
5. **Control Structures**: if-else, switch-case, loops (for, while, do-while).
6. **Functions**: Declaring and defining functions.
7. **Arrays**: Single and multi-dimensional arrays.
8. **Pointers**: Basics of pointers and pointer arithmetic.
9. **Strings**: String manipulation and functions.

## ⚙️ Advanced Topics

1. **Structures and Unions**: Defining and using structures and unions.
2. **File I/O**: Reading from and writing to files.
3. **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: malloc, calloc, realloc, and free.
4. **Preprocessor Directives**: Macros, header files, and conditional compilation.
5. **Linked Lists**: Implementing and using linked lists.
6. **Stacks and Queues**: Implementing stacks and queues.
7. **Trees and Graphs**: Basic tree and graph algorithms.
8. **Sorting and Searching Algorithms**: Common algorithms for sorting and searching.

## 💻 Projects

This section contains various projects to apply your C programming skills:

1. **Simple Calculator**: A basic calculator application.
2. **Club Management System**: A system to manage books in a library.
3. **Bank Management System**: A system to handle banking operations.
